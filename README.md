<p>The field of cognitive neuroscience is being shaken up. Advances in powerful computational hardware and data science methods hold countless possibilities for novel imaging analysis approaches. I aim to develop sound methods and intuitive tools for the rapidly evolving field of computational cognitive neuroscience.<p>

##### My Bio

<p>I'm a cognitive neuroscience research assistant at Weill Cornell Medicine, in the Institute for Developmental Psychobiology and the Geriatric Psychiatry Institute.<p>

<p>I studied math, stats, psychology and neuroscience at the City University of New York (Program for Unique and Interdisciplinary Studies), and graduated in 2022 with a B.S. in Cognitive Science and Computational Methods. In my undergraduate studies, I explored the theoretical underpinnings of statistical methods and machine learning for cognitive neuroscience research.<p>

<p>My research experience spans basic science topics in natural language and visual processing, as well as clinical and translational topics in schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and late-life depression. I am primarily interested in computational methods for neuroimaging analysis, and aspire to develop new methods to improve efficiency and reduce dependence on heuristic methods to increase statistical power of neuroimaging analysis.<p>
