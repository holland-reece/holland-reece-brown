<p>Cognitive neuroscience, like many research fields are now, is being shaken up. Recent advances in the quality and accessibility of powerful computational hardware and data science methods hold countless possibilities for novel imaging analysis approaches. These exciting advances also make honesty and transparency in research more important than ever. I aim to leverage computational innovations to develop sound methods and intuitive tools for the rapidly evolving field of computational cognitive neuroscience, and promote the practices of sharing code and disclosing data analysis procedure.<p>

##### My Bio

<p>I'm a cognitive neuroscience research assistant at Weill Cornell Medicine, in the Institute for Developmental Psychobiology and the Geriatric Psychiatry Institute.<p>

<p>I studied math, stats, psychology and neuroscience at the City University of New York (Program for Unique and Interdisciplinary Studies), and graduated in 2022 with a B.S. in Cognitive Science and Computational Methods. In my undergraduate studies, I explored the theoretical underpinnings of statistical methods and machine learning for cognitive neuroscience research.<p>

<p>My research experience spans basic science topics in natural language and visual processing, as well as clinical and translational topics in schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and late-life depression. I am primarily interested in computational methods for neuroimaging analysis, and aspire to develop new methods to improve efficiency and reduce dependence on heuristic methods to increase statistical power of neuroimaging analysis.<p>
