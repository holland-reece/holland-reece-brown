<p>The field of cognitive neuroscience is being shaken up by data science innovations. Advances in both hardware and approaches hold countless possibilities for novel imaging analysis methods. I apply and develop neuroimaging analysis tools for clincial and translational psychiatric research. Ultimately, I aim to develop sound methods and intuitive tools for the rapidly evolving field of computational cognitive neuroscience.<p>

#### My Bio

<p>I'm a cognitive neuroscience research assistant at Weill Cornell Medicine, in the Institutes for Developmental Psychobiology and the Geriatric Psychiatry. I graduated in 2022 with a B.S. in Cognitive Science and Computational Methods from the City University of New York, Program for Unique and Interdisciplinary Studies. My research experience spans basic science topics in natural language and visual processing, as well as clinical and translational topics in schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. I am primarily interested in neuroimaging analysis, and aspire to develop new computational methods to improve efficiency and increase statistical power.<p>
